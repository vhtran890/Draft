# Draft
Hi everyone! I'm Victoria Tran, a student at the University of Arizona studying Bioinformatics and minoring in Japanese language.
This is my first time using GitHub but I find it very interesting and useful so far. I've previously used Domino which I find similar
to GitHub so hopefully it won't be too difficult to get used to. 

## Hobbies
Some of my hobbies include playing piano, origami, baking/cooking, travelling, and such. I recently got into League of Legends since 
getting a PC. It's been very addicting but difficult to get the hang of.
